The user will be prompted to enter the ID number of the item they would like to purchase, then give the quantity of the item they would like to purchase.  The stock number will then be updated in the MySQL database, and the user will be shown their order total:

After these steps, the program starts over, displays the list of available items, and prompts the user again.
